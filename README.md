# 42_fillit

A program which receives a list of tetris figures (an example can be found in the file ok_00) and arranges them with each others (rotating is forbidden) to make the smallest possible square using recursive backtracking. The resulting square is then printed.
File test.c contains some auxillary functions I used during testing.
